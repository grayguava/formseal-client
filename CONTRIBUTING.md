## Getting started

1. Fork the repository and clone your fork:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/formseal-embed.git
   cd formseal-embed
   ```

2. Install in development mode using `pipx` (recommended) or `pip`:
   ```bash
   pipx install -e .
   ```
3. Verify it works:
   ```bash
   fse
   ```

> **Note:** Always use `pipx install -e .` for local dev — it gives you an isolated environment and the version header will display correctly from source.

## Versioning

The version string lives in **`version.txt`** and is the single source of truth. The publish workflow reads it and injects it into the code at build time.

When preparing a release:
1. Update `version.txt` with the new version (e.g. `1.0.0`)
2. Trigger the **Publish to PyPI** workflow from GitHub Actions

Do not edit the `version` field in `pyproject.toml` manually — it gets overwritten by the workflow.

---

## Code style

- Add a comment at the top of each logical block explaining what it does
- Follow the patterns already in the file you're editing
- Use the `cli/ui` module helpers (`info`, `fail`, `warn`, `br`, `header`) for all terminal output
- Validate before writing — never persist invalid state
- Never expose secrets or keys in output

---

## Submitting changes

1. Create a branch off `main`:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feat/my-feature
   ```

2. Make your changes and test locally (see [Testing](#testing))

3. Commit with clear, descriptive messages

4. Push and open a pull request against `main`

---

## Testing

Test the relevant commands manually before opening a PR:

```bash
fse                          # check about displays correctly
fse init                     # scaffold a project
fse set endpoint             # interactive endpoint config
fse set key                  # interactive key config
fse --status                 # show current config
fse doctor                   # validate configuration
fse field add email type:email  # add a field
```

If your change touches the install/packaging path, test both install methods:
```bash
pipx install -e .            # local dev
pip install formseal-embed   # from PyPI (after publishing)
```
